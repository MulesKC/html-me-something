                <p>
                    Wilderness backpacking is a hobby that I'm passionate about. For me, it is very rewarding to get away from civilization and enjoy nature. However, there is a great deal of preparation needed before heading out into a forest for 3 days. Although not an exclusive list, I will try to give you some pointers.

                <p>
                    Your sleep system is the most critical part of your gear. It typically includes a hiker's:

                    <ul>
                        <li>tent</li>
                        <li>sleeping bag</li>
                        <li>sleeping pad</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>There are infinite variations depending on personal tastes such as using hammock setup instead of a tent.</br> </br>
                    At most points in deciding on gear, a decision between camping luxury and hiking ease must be made. Figure out what works for you through practice.
