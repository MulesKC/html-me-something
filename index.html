                <p>
                    Wilderness backpacking is a hobby that I'm passionate about. For me, it is very rewarding to get away from civilization and enjoy nature. However, there is a great deal of preparation needed before heading out into a forest for 3 days. Although not an exclusive list, I will try to give you some pointers. </br> </br>
                    At most points in deciding on gear, a decision between camping luxury and hiking ease must be made. Figure out what your preferences are through lots practice both in your backyard and in some low-risk wilderness like a local campground. Once you are comfortable with your setup, start planning a trip to get your feet wet! As a beginner, it is a good idea to plan trips in foreseeably good weather not too far from civilization.

                    <h3>Sleep System</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your sleep system is the most critical part of your gear. It typically includes a hiker's:
                        <ul>
                            <li>tent</li>
                            <li>sleeping bag</li>
                            <li>sleeping pad</li>
                        </ul>
                        There are infinite variations depending on personal tastes such as using hammock setup instead of a tent.</br> </br>

                    <h3>Backpack</h3>
                        <p>
                            You guessed it, in backpacking your backpack is an important piece of gear. You will need a backpack designed for hiking, your Jansport&reg; won't work here. When choosing a pack, <a href ="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacks-adjusting-fit.html">make sure it fits</a>. </br>
                            In short, wilderness backpacking is the activity of carrying a backpack for miles in the wilderness - make sure you have a pack that you like.
